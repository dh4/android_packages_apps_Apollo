# Customized Apollo

Apollo music player with my own customizations:

 - Show artist name instead of song in songs view, playlists, favorites, last added.
 - Show songs instead of albums in recent view.
 - If no album art can be found, display artist image instead in now playing view and lock screen.
 - Increase disk cache size to 250mb.
 - Change name to com.dh4.apollo to prevent conflict with Cyanogenmod default app.

An apk file can be found under releases. I may clean up these edits at some point and submit them to Cyanogenmod as customizable options.
